## 2026-01-21 - Fix Reflected XSS in Error Handling **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `main.go`. The `ServeHTTP` function handled errors by injecting `err.Error()` directly into a `<script>alert(...)` block without escaping. An attacker who could trigger an error containing malicious characters (e.g., via config injection or data-driven errors) could execute arbitrary JavaScript. **Learning:** Always treat error messages as untrusted input when rendering them to HTML or JavaScript contexts. `fmt.Fprintf` with `%s` is insufficient for safe output in these contexts. **Prevention:** Use `encoding/json`'s `Marshal` function to safely serialize strings for use in JavaScript, ensuring all special characters are properly escaped.
